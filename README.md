# Traffic-signal
This project simulates a smart traffic signal system that adjusts green light durations based on real-time traffic data. It combines Fuzzy Logic for initial decision-making and Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning) to optimize signal timings over time, improving traffic flow at intersections.
